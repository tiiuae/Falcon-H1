## 🚀 Introduction

We are excited to introduce **Falcon-H1**, the latest evolution in the Falcon family of large language models. Built upon an advanced **hybrid architecture**—where each block integrates both **State Space Models (SSMs)** and **Attention Mechanisms**, these models span a wide range of scales, from **500 million to 34 billion parameters**, making them suitable for both lightweight inference on edge devices and large-scale deployments in data centers.

**Falcon-H1** was initially trained with support for **18 core languages**, with scalability to **100+ languages**, achieving state-of-the-art multilingual and reasoning performances in **instruction following**, **maths**, **coding**, and **conversational tasks**.

### ✨ 1.Key Highlights

Built by the **Technology Innovation Institute (TII)** in Abu Dhabi, **Falcon-H1** is the latest step in pushing the frontier of hybrid transformer design. Main key highlights are :

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Each transformer block processes all channels through both **SSM** and **Attention** in parallel, then **sums the outputs**. This allows the model to benefit from both **long-range memory** (via SSMs) and **local/global attention** simultaneously.

- **Scalable Sizes**: Models available at multiple scales: **500M**, **1.5B**, **3B**, **7B**,and **34B** parameters.

- **Efficient Reasoning**: The hybrid structure enhances **reasoning** and **task generalization**.
  
- **Multilingual by Design**: Native training in **18 languages**, with scalability to 100+ languages thanks to our **multilingual
tokenizer** trained on diverse language datasets, with strong **zero-shot translation** and **instruction-following** abilities.

- **Instruction-Following and Agent Capabilities**: Tuned for **instruction following**, **multi-turn conversations**, and already **integrated with major inference engines** such as **vLLM**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **llama.cpp** — with more coming soon.

## Inference

Make sure to install the latest version of `transformers` or `vllm`, eventually install these packages from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```

Refer to [the official vLLM documentation for more details on building vLLM from source](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation/gpu.html#build-wheel-from-source).

### 1.🤗 transformers
[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) is a library of pretrained natural language processing for inference and training.
Refer to the snippet below to run H1 models using 🤗 transformers:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1B-Base"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  model_id,
  torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
  device_map="auto"
)

# Perform text generation
```

### 2.vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
to run Falcon-H1 models , you can refer to the following command:

```
# pip install vllm
vllm serve tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1B-Instruct --tensor-parallel-size 2 --data-parallel-size 1
```

### 3.`llama.cpp`

Refer to the model cards of our GGUF models and follow the installation instructions to run the model with `llama.cpp`.

## Performance and Throughput:
A detailed dynamic evaluation report is provided in our [blogpost](#):
 1.We compare the performance of each **Falcon-H1** model against the strongest models not only with the same size but also twice their size.
 2.We show that Falcon-H1 models achieve state of the art performance in most benchmarks(reasoning, maths , coding , in-context learning , and more) 
 outperforming some closed source as gpt-4o-mini in coding and maths related tasks.
The blogpost contains also a separate part highlighting the inference-speed of Falcon-H1 against other attention-free and attention-with models across a wide range of sequence-lengths and batch size.
## 📦 Falcon-H1 Features at a Glance

- **Parallel Hybrid Blocks**: Attention + SSM in every layer.
- **100+ Languages Supported**: Multilingual instruction, chat, and translation.
- - **Scalable Sizes**: From **500M** to **34B**.
- **Full Ecosystem Integration**: Runs on widely used inference stacks and supports common file formats (**HF**, **GGUF**).
- **Quantized + Fine-tune Friendly**: Models available in **8-bit**, **4-bit**, and standard **FP16**.
